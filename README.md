# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup for using React in Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules to help maintain code quality.

## Features

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enables instant live refresh without losing state while editing React components.
- **ESLint Integration**: Includes ESLint to automatically enforce a set of coding standards and catch common bugs.

## Official Plugins

The template includes support for two official plugins:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react): Utilizes Babel to enable Fast Refresh, ensuring that you can see changes in real-time without losing component state during development.
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react-swc): Leverages SWC to provide Fast Refresh capabilities, offering an alternative to Babel with potentially faster build times.
